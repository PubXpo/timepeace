## Introduction

<!-- add short description -->
Timepeace was created in response to the need for a tool to manage projects, and hourly business activities, generate client invoices and store them in a database to retrieve later.

It was implemented with contractors in mind. It used surveys on online platforms to gather intel on issues contractors faced and what they needed from a potential solution.

This is a lite demo version.
